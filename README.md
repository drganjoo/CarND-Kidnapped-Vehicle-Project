# Overview

## Project Introduction
Your robot has been kidnapped and transported to a new location! Luckily it has a map of this location, a (noisy) GPS estimate of its initial location, and lots of (noisy) sensor and control data.

In this project a 2 dimensional particle filter has been implemented in C++. The particle filter has been given a map and some initial localization information (analogous to what a GPS would provide). At each time step the filter gets an observation and control data. 

## Running the Code
This project involves the Term 2 Simulator which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases)
